I'm a newbie and my process for creating a program is to use an outline that described what  I want and how I think I would structure the program.  Here is my latest intial outline.  Any comments about it or any discussion of how you get from concept to actually writing code would be great.


This program is being developed to allow me to Hide/Unhide shares on my local Network

Here is what I've used in the past via a Power Shell script

# Function to hide a network share
function Hide-NetworkShare {
    param (
        [string]$shareName,
        [string]$folderPath
    )
    $shareNameHidden = $shareName + "$"
    Remove-SmbShare -Name $shareName -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    New-SmbShare -Name $shareNameHidden -Path $folderPath -FullAccess Everyone
    Write-Host "Network share '$shareName' is now hidden as '$shareNameHidden'."
}

# Function to unhide a network share
function Unhide-NetworkShare {
    param (
        [string]$shareNameHidden,
        [string]$folderPath
    )
    $shareName = $shareNameHidden.TrimEnd('$')
    Remove-SmbShare -Name $shareNameHidden -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
    New-SmbShare -Name $shareName -Path $folderPath -FullAccess Everyone
    Write-Host "Network share '$shareNameHidden' is now unhidden as '$shareName'."
}

I want to set this up in VB .Net using Windows Forms or C# .Net using Windows Forms
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- power Shell is a console app - I want a complied window application
- the password, Share Drives, and Share Names are hard coded into the script 
- I want an app that will let me assign these items dynamically inside the compiled app

Setting this up in VB as Simple Solution
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use the My.Settings Object to dynamically store and retrieve my properties
- create a start up form that runs the first time the program is run
Forms - StartupForm, PswdForm, HideUnHideForm
OR
- create a setup program that populates the My.Settings Object during the program installation
Setup Program Forms - SetupForm
Apllication Forms - PswdForm, HideUnHideForm

Setting this up in VB as Enhanced Solution
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Same as Simple Solution Except
- originally only store the Password and trivial data like styles and colors in the My.Settings Object
- utilze the OpenFileDialog class to allow users to browse for and or create a name and path for the desired share
- store the ShareName and Share Path in the My.Settings object
OR
- create a form that incorporates the OpenFiileDialog and allows the user to Hide & Unhide the selected Drive/Directory from within that form
- leave the shares as is when the program ends OR default all shares to hidden or visible at program end

        Dim classInstance As New ManagementClass(scope, path, options)

        Dim inParams As ManagementBaseObject = classInstance.GetMethodParameters("Create")
        inParams("Name") = shareName
        inParams("Path") = folderPath
        inParams("Type") = 0 ' Disk Drive
        inParams("Access") = "Everyone:Full"

        Dim outParams As ManagementBaseObject = classInstance.InvokeMethod("Create", inParams, Nothing)
    End Sub
End Module


This VB.NET code defines a module NetworkShareManager with a method UnhideNetworkShare that takes two parameters: shareNameHidden and folderPath. The method removes an existing hidden share and creates a new unhidden share.
Please note that you need to add a reference to the System.Management namespace in your VB.NET project to use the ManagementObjectSearcher and ManagementClass classes.
Also, this code requires administrative privileges to manage network shares. Make sure to run your application with elevated permissions.
